--   Tables used in the Bank X example of simple data virtualization for analytics 

--  The following sequence of SQL commands creates and populates with data from FCH1 
--  ( the table of full Customer History information), the Bank X
--  tables owned by different Bank X divisions US WEST, US EASTS, EUROPE.  The data from the regional
--  tables FCH_USW, FCH_USE and FCH_EUR can be used for Customer Segmentation analytics. The example shows
--  how to discover and import these data assets into ICPD and use logic in a ICPD Jupyter notebook to union 
--  the data from these different regional tables as source information for the Customer Segmentation analytics 
--  Since the customer history data has approx 300 columns, we simplify the example by creating regional customer 
--  customer History tables with identical column structure. The techniques of the ICPD regularizing column names 
--  for the Live Event prediction ICPD IA could be applied if in practise there were differences in column structure 
-- between the different regions . 

-- this script assumes that the table  FCH1 has already been created and loaded with customer hostorydata from a 
--  following the instructions in Step 4 of the tutorial guide. 
--  This SQl script is used in Step 5 of the tutorial where regional Customer history tables are created and populated.
--  The regional tables FCH_USW, FCH_USE and FCH_EUR are created by the following script and populated
--  by partioning the information previously loaded into the FCH1 table.

--  step 1 create the FCH_USW table 

create table FCH_USW like FCH1;  

-- populate with  1/3 of the customer records from FCH1
insert into FCH_USW 
   select * FROM FCH1 
      where MOD(CUSTOMER_CUSTOMER_ID,3)= 0;  
  
 --  check success 
 
 select count(*) from FCH_USW ;

--  step 2 create the FCH_USE table 

create table FCH_USE like FCH1;  

-- populate with different 1/3 of the customer records from FCH1

insert into FCH_USE 
   select * FROM FCH1 
      where MOD(CUSTOMER_CUSTOMER_ID,3)= 1;  
 
 --  check success 
 select count(*) from FCH_USE ;
 
 --  step 2 create the FCH_EUR table 
 
 create table FCH_EUR like FCH1;  

-- populate with final 1/3 of the customer records from FCH1

insert into FCH_EUR 
   select * FROM FCH1 
      where MOD(CUSTOMER_CUSTOMER_ID,3)= 2;  
 
 --  check success 
 
 select count(*) from FCH_EUR ;
